# Database-II-Final-Project
Using a programming language to create a web-based or mobile application to interact with NoSQL database.
## Project Description:
Create two HTML pages one with the login information as in figure 1. You will need to 
create a table (using any SQL database) with the user information to login to your 
application. You must have at least 5 users and allow a new user to register. The other page 
will allow the user to search for a restaurant (that stores in MongoDB) using several fields 
(i.e. street, borough, cuisine, grade, name). The HTML pages will serve as a client side 
(front-end) and on the server side (back-end) you will have your code running to interact 
with the HTML pages.
Steps to run the project:
1- Create a table with the login information.
2- Create a mongodb with restaurant information that you used in lab 7.
3- At server sides, you need to connect to your SQL (page 1) and NoSQL database
(page 2).
4- User enters the login information. If succussed, will go to page 2. If not, a message 
will display that the information isnâ€™t correct. 
5- New user will be able to register.
6- In page two, user will enter information in any of the fields (street, borough, cuisine,
grade, name) and you must display the result back to user. If no restaurant matches 
the entered information, display a message to the user that no result
